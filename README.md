# Event-Pi
Created by Georgios Tsianakas https://github.com/GTsianakas giorgostsianakas@hotmail.com

This project aims to become an event based python library for Raspberry pi GPIO using python and curses to allow simple network support over ssh

The project is still in a very early stage and would propably be re-writen at a point to become a real library rather than a script

Contributions to add functionality before or after the modifications of the code are welcome

This software was created as an educational tool for me and for anyone who would like to use it, it aims to become an abstraction over basic algorithms for control of the GPIO pins with sensors, motors, leds etc.., and to be used by others including people who just started learning to code or children and additionally be powerfull enough to be used for more advance projects and rapid prototyping.
